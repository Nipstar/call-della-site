      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        Call Della collects information in two primary categories:
      </p>
      <h3>A. Customer Information</h3>
      <p>
        Information regarding the law firms that subscribe to our service, including billing details, firm configurations, user accounts, and CRM integration credentials.
      </p>
      <h3>B. Caller Information</h3>
      <p>
        Information provided by prospective clients who interact with the Call Della AI on behalf of our Customers. This includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Audio recordings of the intake call.</li>
        <li>Transcripts generated from the audio.</li>
        <li>Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as names, phone numbers, and addresses.</li>
        <li>Case-specific facts, which may include details regarding physical injuries or medical treatment.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. How We Use the Information</h2>
      <p>
        Call Della operates strictly as a data processor for the Caller Information. We use this data <strong>exclusively</strong> to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Facilitate the conversational intake.</li>
        <li>Generate the triage dossier (summary, transcript, extracted data fields).</li>
        <li>Deliver that dossier securely to the Customer (the law firm).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Zero Data Retention for Model Training</h2>
      <p>
        We recognize the absolute necessity of attorney-client privilege. <strong>Call Della strictly prohibits the use of Caller Information (audio, transcripts, or summaries) to train public Foundational LLMs.</strong> We utilize enterprise-grade API agreements with our sub-processors (such as OpenAI or Anthropic) that explicitly opt out of data retention for model training.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell, trade, or rent Caller Information to third parties. Caller Information is only accessible by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The specific law firm (Customer) that the caller intended to reach.</li>
        <li>Our authorized sub-processors (e.g., cloud hosting providers) strictly for the purpose of executing the Service, all of whom are bound by strict confidentiality agreements.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We implement robust, industry-standard security measures, including at-rest and in-transit encryption (AES-256 and TLS 1.2+), to protect Caller Information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. 
      </p>

      <h2>6. Data Deletion Requests</h2>
      <p>
        Because Call Della acts as a data processor on behalf of the law firm, any requests from callers to delete their data must be directed to the respective law firm. We provide our Customers with the tooling necessary to permanently expunge records from our infrastructure upon request.
